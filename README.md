# MATH303 Course Project

This is MATH303 Course Project. In this project, we studied Josephson effect and Josephson junction by analogy with the Pendulum model with constant and
time-periodic forcing, and by solving the corresponding ordinary differential equation, and applied bifurcation diagrams and Poincare mappings to analyze 
the change in the number of equilibria, the stability of the system, and the dynamic change process of the solutions.
